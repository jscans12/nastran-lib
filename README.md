# nastran-lib

## Prerequisites
You must have MATLAB R2019a or later (earlier versions may work but are untested), and also must have the h5io package on your MATLAB path. The h5io package can be found either on [GitHub](https://github.com/jscans12/h5io) or the [MATLAB FileExchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/126235-h5io).

## Overview
This toolbox remains a work in progress, but can provide a starting point to anyone who wants to:
- Read/write bdf files
- Read MSC NASTRAN HDF5 files
- Read some OP4 files
